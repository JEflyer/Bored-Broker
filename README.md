# TODO
1. UNDERSTAND Polygon Supernet technically. 
2. Decide the model for bridging the country specific tokens in different supernets
3. Check how we can implement the token for each country on their supuernet.
    a. Back by the country assets as the FIAT.
    b. Price set according to a particular currency. 
    1 Dollar  = Rs 80 
    1 RsToken = 0.0125 Dollar
